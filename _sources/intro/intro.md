# Welcome to F540 Jupyter book 

This is the interactive Jupyter book  supporting the F540 electronics lab course (5th semester) tought at the Gleb Wataghin Physics Institute (IFGW), University of Campinas. 
## What is it about?
If you are not familiar with the concept of JupyterBooks, the idea is to build an executable books where the reader is not only able to copy the code used throughout the book construction, but also dinamically interact with the book content using a local or cloud-based deployment of Jupyter. If you never heard about Jupyter, please have a look at the project homepage [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). If you want to see other examples of executable books,  please check out the [**Executable Book Project**  gallery  page](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/gallery.html)

## Why are we using this for a  electronics lab course?
At the course tought at IFGW, we focus not only at understanding and assembling basic analog electronics circuits (filters, amplifiers, oscillators, switched power supply), but also at developing the analytical and programming skills to acquire experimental data in a script-oriented fashion (instead of writing **everything** down in the lab notebook). Along the years, we realized that students often lack the programming (or scripting) skills necessary to process capture, process, and quantitatively analyse the data.
