abstract = {Incandescent lamp has an important role in the electrical lighting application and are used across the world. It has been used as the classic lighting solution for many years and still consider as parent source of lighting. These lamps use tungsten filament to emit light. Being a resistive device, incandescent lamp maintains a high power factor. In this paper, nonlinear nature of resistance of incandescent lamp has been experimentally verified with the help of few laboratory instruments. Based on this study, relationship between various electrical parameters is developed to understand the nonlinearity of incandescent lamp. This study is important for power requirement and efficiency analysis of any lighting infrastructure.},

@article{Dai2017,
abstract = {Oscillators are components providing clock signals. They are widely required by low-cost on-chip applications, such as biometric sensors and SoCs. As part of a sensor, a relaxation oscillator is implemented to provide a clock reference. Lim- ited by the sensor application, a clock reference outside the sensor is not desired. An RC implementation of the oscillator has a balanced accuracy performance with low-cost advantage. Hence an RC relaxation oscillator is chosen to provide the clock inside the sensor. This thesis proposes a current mode relaxation oscillator to achieve low frequency standard deviation across different supplies, temperatures and process corners. A comparison between a given relaxation oscillator and the proposed design is made as well. All oscillators in this thesis use 0.18 µm technology and 1.8 V nom- inal supply. The proposed oscillator manages to achieve a frequency standard de- viation across all PVT variations less than ±6.5% at 78.4 MHz output frequency with a power dissipation of 461.2 µW. The layout of the oscillator's core area takes up 0.003 mm2.},

abstract = {Abstract Volcanic lakes provide windows into the interior of volcanoes as they integrate the heat flux discharged by a magma body and condense volcanic gases. Volcanic lake temperatures and geochemical compositions therefore typically serve as warnings for resumed unrest or prior to eruptions. If acidic and hot, these lakes are usually considered to be too convective to allow any stratification within their waters. Kawah Ijen volcano, featuring the largest hyperacidic lake on Earth (volume of 27 million m3), is less homogeneous than previously thought. Hourly temperature measurements reveal the development of a stagnant layer of cold waters (<30 °C), overlying warmer and denser water (generally above 30 °C and density ∼1.083 kg/m3). Examination of 20 yrs of historical records and temporary measurements show a systematic thermal stratification during rainy seasons. The yearly rupture of stratification at the end of the rainy season causes a sudden release of dissolved gases below the cold water layer which appears to generate a lake overturn, i.e. limnic eruption, and a resonance of the lake, i.e. a seiche, highlighting a new hazard for these extreme reservoirs. A minor non-volcanic event, such as a heavy rainfall or an earthquake, may act as a trigger. The density driven overturn requires specific salinity-temperature conditions for the colder and less saline top water layer to sink into the hot saline water. Spectacular degassing occurs when the dissolved gases, progressively stored during the rainy season due to a weakened diffusion of carbon dioxide in the top layer, are suddenly released. These findings challenge the homogenization assumption at acidic lakes and stress the need to develop appropriate monitoring setups. },

abstract = {This paper presents a study of phase noise In two inductorless CMOS oscillators. First-order analysis of a linear oscillatory system leads to a noise shaping function and a new definition of Q. A linear model of CMOS ring oscillaton is used to calcalate their phase noise, and three phase noise phenomena, namely, additive noise, high-frequency multiplicative noise, and low-frequency multiplicative noise, are identified and formulated. Based on the same concepts, a CMOS relaxation osillator is also analyzed. Issues and techniques related to simulation or noise in the time domain are described, and two prototypes fabricated in a 0.5-$\mu$m CMOS technology are used to investigate the accuracy of the theoretical predictions. Compared with the measured results, the calculated phase noise values of a 2-GHz ring oscillator and a 900-MHz relaxation oscillator at 5 MHz offset have an error of approximately 4 dB.},

The series aims to create a systematic library of LED-based materials and to provide the readers with the description of experiments and pedagogical treatment that would help their students construct, test, and apply physics concepts and mathematical relations. The first paper, published in the February 2014 issue of TPT,1 provided an overview of possible uses of LEDs in a physics course. The second paper2 discussed how one could help students learn the foundational aspects of LED physics through a scaffolded inquiry approach, specifically the ISLE cycle. The goals of this paper are to show how the activities described in our second paper help to deepen student understanding of physics and to broaden student knowledge by exploring new phenomena such as fluorescence. Activities described in this paper are suitable for advanced high school courses, introductory courses for physics and engineering majors, courses for prospective physics teachers, and professional development programs.},

abstract = {Peer Instruction is an instructional strategy for engaging students during class through a structured questioning process that involves every student. Here we de- scribe Peer Instruction (hereafter PI) and report data from more than ten years of teaching with PI in the calculus- and algebra-based introductory physics courses for non-majors at Harvard University, where this method was developed. Our results indicate increased student mastery of both conceptual reasoning and quantitative problem solving upon implementing PI. Gains in student understanding are greatest when the PI questioning strategy is accompanied by other strategies that increase stu- dent engagement, so that every element of the course serves to involve students ac- tively. We also provide data on gains in student understanding and information about implementation obtained from a survey of almost four hundred instructors using PI at other institutions. We find that most of these instructors have had success using PI, and that their students understand basic mechanics concepts at the level characteristic of courses taught with interactive engagement methods. Finally, we provide a sample set of materials for teaching a class with PI, and provide information on the extensive resources available for teaching with PI.},
